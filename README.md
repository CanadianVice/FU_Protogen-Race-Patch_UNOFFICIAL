# [UNOFFICIAL] Protogen Race Patch for Frackin' Universe 
> Game: Starbound | (Buy it on: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/), [GoG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/starbound))

Gives your character unique stats, really letting them shine with Frackin' Universe by integrating Bun/Shotshell156's "Protogen Race Mod" with Frackin' Universe's stats system. Requires both mods to play. Note: there may be frequent refinements, hitting a good place with these values is a bit trial-and-error.

⚠ The compiled PAK is for non-steam ONLY. See the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808096136) to install for Steam.  
⚠ If you use Frackin' **Races** standalone, do not use this version. See headed section 'What if I use Frackin' Races?' below.

This mod is **unofficial**. See below for contact information.

## What's Different From FU's Official Protogen Integration?
* FU has requirements for stats that may be too restrictive for some tastes. This project does what seems fun - but it may not be 'balanced'. *Feedback is welcome!*
* More direct attention - this handles one species, FU has a plethora to deal with.
* Emphasis on a good mix of lore compatibility, with some artistic license to mix with Starbound.
* Sayter and the FU team are professionals, I'm not. If you need that touch and experienced balancing, I'm not it.
* Protogen weapons are given a racial tag - unique Protogen stats, so you don't miss out!
* Protogen do get at minimum basic support whichever you pick! So go with what you like!
   
## Installation Instructions
⚠ You must have *Frackin Universe* by Sayter, and *Protogen Race Mod* by Bun/Shotshell156; see the 'Required Mods' section below.

It will have further explanation as to the stats changed, why, and most other relevant information.

## What if I use Frackin' Races?
Firstly: FR is *not* compatible with the mainline patch linked in the areas above. You *will* crash if you attempt to use that one instead of following the instructions in this segment.
- Non-Steam: See the installation instructions above, but extract the .pak file from the [*zip*](https://github.com/CanadianVice/Starbound__FU_Protogen-Race-Patch_UNOFFICIAL/releases/tag/v1.0.0) here instead.
- Steam: See the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2885865644) FR-standalone patch. Note: Does NOT work together with the mainline. Only for Frackin' Races.
  If you try to use both versions of this patch, you *will* crash.
