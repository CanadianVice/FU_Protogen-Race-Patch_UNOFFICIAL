# [UNOFFICIAL] Protogen Race Patch for Frackin' Universe 
> Game: Starbound | (Buy it on: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/), [GoG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/starbound))

Gives your character unique stats, really letting them shine with Frackin' Universe by integrating Bun/Shotshell156's "Protogen Race Mod" with Frackin' Universe's stats system. Requires both mods to play.

FU already includes basic stats officially, but they're pretty mundane.

⚠ The compiled PAK is for non-steam ONLY. See the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808096136) to install for Steam.

This mod is **not officially** sanctioned by either mentioned project. Do not contact them for support or comments/concerns. 
   
## Installation Instructions [Non-Steam]
⚠ You must have *Frackin Universe* by Sayter, and *Protogen Race Mod* by Bun/Shotshell156; this mod does nothing without them.
1. Download the [.PAK](https://github.com/CanadianVice/FU_Protogen-Race-Patch_UNOFFICIAL/blob/main/fu_protogen1_racepatch.pak) file in this repository. 
2. Go into the game files directory where starbound.exe (a level deeper) is on your system.
[ \Starbound\mods ]
3. Place the .PAK file in a distinct folder. Name shouldn't matter.
    * Note: I don't have the non-Steam installed, so it's possible you may just need bare folders. Google's your friend.
    * Presumably, [this method](https://starbounder.org/Mods/Installation#Install_Guide_for_Starbound_Mods) works.
4. Badabing Badaboom, you're done.
	 
For further information about the mod, please see the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808096136).
  
It will have further explanation as to the stats changed, why, and most other relevant information.
