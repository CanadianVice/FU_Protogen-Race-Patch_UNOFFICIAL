# [UNOFFICIAL] Protogen Race Patch for Frackin' Universe 
> Game: Starbound | (Buy it on: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/), [GoG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/starbound))

Gives your character unique stats, really letting them shine with Frackin' Universe by integrating Bun/Shotshell156's "Protogen Race Mod" with Frackin' Universe's stats system. Requires both mods to play.

FU already includes basic stats officially, but they're pretty mundane. This mod also puts more focus on thematic accuracy and includes some anti-annoyance items like removing slime bounce.

⚠ The compiled PAK is for non-steam ONLY. See the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808096136) to install for Steam.

This mod is **unofficial**. See below for contact information.
