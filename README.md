# [UNOFFICIAL] Protogen Race Patch for Frackin' Universe
Gives your character unique stats, really letting them shine with Frackin' Universe by integrating Bun/Shotshell156's "Protogen Race Mod" with Frackin' Universe's stats system. Requires both mods to play.

FU already includes basic stats officially, but they're pretty mundane.

⚠ The compiled PAK is for non-steam ONLY. See the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808096136) to install for Steam.

This mod is **not officially** sanctioned by either mentioned project. Do not contact them for support or comments/concerns. 
   
## Installation Instructions [Non-Steam]
⚠ You must have *Frackin Universe* by Sayter, and *Protogen Race Mod* by Bun/Shotshell156; this mod does nothing without them.
1. Download the .PAK file in this repository. 
2. Go into the game files directory where starbound.exe (a level deeper) is on your system.
[ \Starbound\mods ]
3. Place the .PAK file there
..* Note: I don't have the non-Steam installed, so it's possible you may just need bare folders. Google's your friend.
4. Badabing Badaboom, you're done.
	 
For further information about the mod, please see the [*Steam Workshop*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2808096136).
  
It will have further explanation as to the stats changed, why, and most other relevant information.
