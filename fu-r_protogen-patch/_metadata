  "description" : "Integrates Bun/Shotshell156's \"Protogen Race Mod\" with Frackin' Universe's stats system. [b]Requires both mods to play[/b].\n\nTHIS MOD IS NOT OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED BY FRACKIN' UNIVERSE OR PROTOGEN RACE MOD. \nIt is not officially supported, so [b]please do not trouble them if there are issues[/b].\n[i]See bottom of page / sidebar for attributions, contact, additional information, etc.[/i]\n\nThis was mostly designed on a whim as a personal project, so it's going to show that. I have tested compatibility, and everything seems to work fine - but I can virtually guarantee the stats are not balanced. \n\nThere may be frequent refinements as feedback is received. Most 'updates' you may find are going to be related to tweaking text, I'm a bit of a perfectionist and it's trial and error for some. [b]Always defer to in-game stats for the most up-to-date values[/b].\n\n[h1]What does this patch do?[/h1]\nGives your character unique stats, really letting them shine with Frackin' Universe! Check out some of the details:\n\nAs of V1.00:\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/WGm13Tu.png[/img]\n\nDiet: Their digestive systems are highly functional, being a mix of augments and biological materials. They can eat plants, meat (raw as well!), and even robotic food without ill-effects.\n\n[b]Summary of Perks/Resistances[/b]\nBeing built to explore, they possess decent natural strength, armour, and health. Combined with their innate energy reserves and efficient use thereof, it makes them highly survivable if able to keep enemies at distance or in ambush.\n\nThey recover quickly from exhaustion, aided by their cybernetic components. They move easily with these enhancements, taking less fall damage and remaining stable on most surfaces. They are deceptively light on their feet; the weight their cybernetics grant enables them to hold their ground.\n\nThey have small buffs to mobility as well, being able to offload the worst aspects of movement to highly capable processors and unfatiguable machinery. Given their nature, they integrate technology with ease, enjoying additional perks from common mobility techs.\n\nWith advanced co-processors helping modulate neuroactivity, they are not taken by insanity, though Protogen still understand fear and worry from what lies beyond the pale. It is still possible to take damage, but no ambient environment will chip away at your sanity without sanction.\n\nThe environment challenges them less, however they are not wholly immune due to the tight integration of the biological components; moderate temperature swings are taken in stride, and they can survive without air for longer than most biological creatures. They will die, though, if deprived or forced to survive in extreme environments without exterior protection.\n\nA perk of their integrated systems comes as poison immunity - while it might otherwise damage healthy cells, their machinery filters blood and repairs them without issue, making them immune. \n\n[b]Summary of Weaknesses[/b]\nThe duality of their constitution does however mean some problems!\n\nRadiation is very bad for a Protogen; it easily fries relays and flesh alike. Being a mixture of biological and cybernetic parts, shielding is nigh impossible, rendering both vulnerable. Be it from a barrel or the cosmic background, it is better avoided without strong protection. Cosmic radiation is just spicy rads, so beware!\n\nElectricity is similarly a poor mix for Protogen. Both of these hazards attack each side of a Protogen, making them particularly dangerous as neither biological or cybernetic systems are able to compensate sufficiently when both are under assault.\n\nOtherwise, they maintain no special weakness or strengths over other species; the many hazards you may encounter out in the universe are no more likely to spare them, be it dunking in pools of acid or triggering a nest of bees. But safety is a poor guarantor of adventure, and a Protogen loathes boredom among all else!\n\n[b]Summary Regarding Weapons Stats[/b]\n\nProtogen integrate easily with advanced technologies, giving them bonuses with several. Additionally, with faster reactions and advanced computational elements ready to help, they target easily and effectively for great accuracy.\n\nThey gain bonuses with the following weapon types:\n[list]\n[*]Protogen: They made it, didn't they? Higher damage. (Note: As weapons are in active development, some may not be added to this category yet. I'll try to keep up)\n[*]Energy: Higher energy pool and greater punch when fired\n[*]Sniper: Every shot counts, and the Protogen can count on a great shot. High critical chance and damage buff.\n[*]Magnorb: Technology is a Protogen's best friend, and they enjoy significant bonuses in damage output and defense, integrating them easily.\n[*]Precursor: The Protogen know not who built them, but they find themselves strangely familiar with these weapons, as if part of a deleted memory.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Gameplay Tips[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Radiation burns. Quite badly. Elder Stone inflicts Rad 3 if you step on it, so be aware.\n[*]It can take a while to earn weapons the Protogen get bonuses on, but you should still spawn with a trusty Protogen sword!\n[*]FU's stats stack when items meet multiple categories. You can get some serious damage with this!\n[*]If you want to see what categories a weapon belongs to, probably the easiest way is to look at the FU source code. It's pretty readable.\n[list]\n[*][url=https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse/tree/master/items/active/weapons]Frackin' Universe Weapons Data[/url]\n[*][url=https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinRaces/tree/master/items/active/weapons]Frackin' Races Weapons Data[/url]\n[/list]\n[*]Need madness? Using Eldritch decor like paintings can help; further, it is possible to temporarily disable racial stats via your ship computer. Be wary! That means *all* of them!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Required Mods / Compatibility[/h1]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149][i]Frackin' Universe[/i][/url] by Sayter\n- Note: While for the time being it *should* work with Frackin' Races if somehow you insist on an old version, but that mod is deprecated and unnecessary now. You're best to update Frackin' Universe and uninstall it since the FU-with-FR-integrated version is what I tested with.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1789115955][i]Protogen Race Mod[/i][/url] by Bun/Shotshell156\n- Note: If you get log crashes regarding redundant tags or bad JSON loads of Protogen Race Mod content, it's probably my mod doing it - I patched some weapons as they were lacking the tag at the time. In theory, this shouldn't trigger problems, but just a heads-up.\n\n\n[h1]Contact Info[/h1]\n\nPLEASE DO LEAVE FEEDBACK ON STATS! \nI would do well to have opinions other than my own inform the character of 'balancing' for this.\n\nProbably the best way to get in touch if you find something buggy/lacking regarding this addon is a ping on the [url=https://discord.gg/2SPKs4Y]ProtogenBound Discord[/url]\n@CanadianVice\n\nPlease note, I'm not a dedicated mod author. I mostly did this on a whim, so don't set your expectations too high. I'll try and address things, but it's... not a priority. I'm mostly listing this publicly as some in the community requested as much.\n\n(And yes, I know the logo sucks. I'm not a graphic designer.)",
